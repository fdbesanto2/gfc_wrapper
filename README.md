### Base Forest mask and Fragmentation
This application allows the user to: <br/>
    - define an area of interest <br/>
    - retrieve tree cover change data from the Hansen et al., (2013) dataset.  <br/>
    - combine the layers to produce a forest change map, for a given canopy cover threshold <br/>
    - use a fragmentation tool (Vogt & Ritter, 2017) to measure the integrity of forests <br/><br/>

### Background info on GFC
GFC provides global layers of information on tree cover and tree cover change since 2000, at 30m spatial resolution and consists of: <br/>
- Tree canopy cover for the year 2000 (treecover2000) <br/>
- Global forest cover gain 2000–2012 (gain) <br/>
- Year of gross forest cover loss event (lossyear) <br/>

### Background info on MSPA
MSPA (Morphological Spatial Pattern Analysis) is a customized sequence of mathematical morphological operators targeted at the description of the geometry and connectivity of the image components. 
<br/>
Based on geometric concepts only, this methodology can be applied at any scale and to any type of digital images in any application field.
